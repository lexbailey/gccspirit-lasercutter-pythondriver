Syntax: tidyhpgl4cutter <input file> <output file>
Take an HPGL file, and clean it of unwanted commands (currently filled polygon plotting and form feeds).
Then split it into chunks starting with a SP (select pen) command.  Sort these chunks into order of the pens used,
and reassemble them back into an HPGL file which now uses the pens in sequence.  Preserve preamble and postamble commands
(ie before the first SP and after the last)

Uses the Chiplotle library: http://music.columbia.edu/cmc/chiplotle/
